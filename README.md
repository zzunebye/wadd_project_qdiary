# wadd_project_qdiary

A diary web application where users can write their experiences of quarantine in progress and share their views on quarantine tips to others, and further get a report when the quarantine is on or done.

To write the codes, we used the well-known AMP stack for server-side programming. In short, an AMP stack is a stack of software components to develop web-based software applications that involve Apache, MySQL, and PHP working together. Since the membersâ€™ computer is not using the same OS (macOS and Windows 10), it could be also said that we used both WAMP and MAMP stack. For the client-side, we used HTML/Javascript/CSS.

In addition, bootstrap, JQuery, and Google Geocode is used.

## Project Functionality and Implementation

Our project is designed with several views, models, and logic. Although the project is not fully developed with an MVC pattern, we tried our best to divide the interests of each component so that the code can be easily read and accessed.

There are several components in our project folder. These are developed as components to show different views to users on each page.

- Login Page

- Register Page

- Home Page

- Journal Page

In addition to these components, there are components used within the components, for performing logics or showing the results of logics.

Furthermore, the model folder includes a dozen of PHP files that perform access to our database and save or fetch relevant information
